# Getting started with Rust

Rust is a great language for systems programming. In this post I'll cover installing Rust, creating a new project, and explaining ownership at a high level.

- Install with `rustup`
- Create a new project with `cargo new myapp`
- Build and run with `cargo run`

More to come in follow-up posts.
