# DevOps Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The DevOps pipeline is a set of automated processes that allow developers and operations teams to work together to build, test, and deploy software. It helps to ensure that code changes are tested and deployed quickly and reliably.

## Stages

1. **Source Control**: This is where the code is stored and managed using a version control system like Git.
2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: This stage involves automatically building and testing the code whenever changes are made. Tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions can be used for CI.
3. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: In this stage, the code is automatically deployed to a staging environment for further testing. If the tests pass, the code can be manually or automatically deployed to production.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: After the code is deployed, it is important to monitor the application and collect logs to ensure it is running smoothly. Tools like Prometheus and ELK Stack can be used for monitoring and logging.

## Tools and Technologies

Here are some of the tools and technologies that I have used in my DevOps pipeline:

- **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.
- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server that helps to automate the CI/CD process.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Prometheus**: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **ELK Stack**: A collection of three open-source products (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) used for searching, analyzing, and visualizing log data in real-time.

## Implementation

Here is a high-level overview of the DevOps pipeline implementation:

1. **Source Control**: The code is stored in a Git repository on GitHub. Developers create feature branches for their changes and submit pull requests for review.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins is configured to automatically build and test the code whenever changes are pushed to the repository. Jenkins uses Docker to create isolated build environments.
3. **Continuous Delivery**: If the build and tests pass, Jenkins deploys the code to a staging environment using Kubernetes. The staging environment is a replica of the production environment, allowing for thorough testing.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus is used to monitor the application and collect metrics. The ELK Stack is used to collect and analyze logs from the application and infrastructure.

## Conclusion

The DevOps pipeline is an essential part of modern software development. It helps to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring that changes are delivered quickly and reliably. By using tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and the ELK Stack, teams can create a robust and efficient DevOps pipeline.
